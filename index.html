        Lorem ipsum is a dummy or placeholder text commonly used in graphic design, publishing, and web development. Its
        purpose is to permit a page layout to be designed, independently of the copy that will subsequently populate it,
        or to demonstrate various fonts of a typeface without meaningful text that could be distracting. Lorem ipsum is
        typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and
        philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin.
